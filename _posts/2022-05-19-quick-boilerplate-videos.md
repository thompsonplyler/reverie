title: Streamining the creation of HTML/CSS boilerplate
categories: [JavaScript, VS Code, HTML, CSS]

One of the unsung secrets of day-to-day development is that in addition to the actual time we spend churning out code and working through our programs' logic, we have to spend huge chunks of time setting up the environment and tools that let us actually get do the work of writing programs, aka the fun part. The list of Stuff You Need To Know to be a good developer is incredibly long, but especially when starting out learning web development, it really helps to be able to jump from a blank desktop into actually making a webpage. 

The question is whether dumb person are dumb. 

The more advanced tools we use, the more robust the utilities other programmers have made to simplify the experience of getting off the ground. All hail `create-react-app` and various other framework templates with command line interface to bang out some boilerplate! But when we want to practice smaller, narrower cases or test JavaScript/CSS without all the baggage of a library or framework, the following instructions will help any developer start their exploration with a running start. 

The following two videos are broken down as follows: 

1. I walk through my mouse-based boilerplate setup with the quickest shortcuts falling to my use of Emmet in VS Code. 
2. I then set up an alias to create the same files without any boilerplate code, reducing the mouse movement to a keyboard command.

> Intermission: Then I tour awesome sites like JSFiddle and Codepen, which handle all the setup for you, although there's rarely a substitute for a local environment you entirely control! 

3. Finally, I demonstrate how to write a shell script and a bash alias to create our starter template with some basic boilerplate already written and all our files linked together.

Let's be clear, the final form of this boilerplate creation is still **just scratching the surface of what's possible with shell scripting!** If you want to take a deep dive, I highly recommend the FREE MIT course ["The Missing Semester of your CS Education"](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) which focuses on this sort of thing: less about code and programming, more about quickly navigating your computing environment so you can more quickly get to the actual work of programming computers.
