Over the course of working as a web developer and learning my trade, I've learned and discarded dozens of tools. I am sure I'll learn and discard dozens more. 

Consider this a snapshot of my current favorite tools as a web developer as well as an attempt to write down the essentials of the modern web development as I understand it. 

This is not a list of tools you will need to install every time. That list doesn't exist. For any item on this list, you need to know what it does and understand why you'll need it. When it doubt, read the docs!

## JavaScript Libraries 
These are libraries that will find use cases for JavaScript developers across most fields.
* lodash - expanded array/object management
* gsap - fast animation library
* node - JS outside the browser. calling this a library is an understatement
* moment | luxon - dates in JS
* uuid - generate strong, non-recurring id keys
* yup - form validation 
* bcrypt - password hashing
* socket.io - websockets in JS

## VS Code Extensions
These extensions are chosen for their broad utility to JavaScript/React developers, especially when it comes to collaboration. 
* Quokka
* Bracket Pair Colorizer
* DotENV
* ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native Snippets
* Github Repositories
* Remote Containers
* Remote SSH
* Remote WSL
* Remote Development
* Remote Repositories
* GitLens
* Live Preview
* Live Server - Special note on Live Server and Live Preview: I am on WSL, and Live Server behaves unpredictably for me. What you *need* is a tool that shows the results of code changes in real time so you're not constantly going back and forth saving and reloading. 
* Live Share
* Prettier

## Ooh, Pretty! 
* I use Material Theme Ocean High Contrast Color Theme
* Material Theme Icons 
* My font is Fira Code

## Software 
* **Some sort of screen capture software.** My primary development environment is Windows, where I use ShareX. On Linux I use flameshot, and on Mac I use Greenshot or Monosnap.   
* **Good note-taking software.** I most recently prefer Cherry Notes or Notion, but I also have a pretty thick "notes" folder with a bunch of subfolders containing markdown.md files that I maintain with VS Code. Your note-taking system will evolve. Because markdown is so portable, I tend to prefer note-taking tools that have a ready answer for markdown support.
