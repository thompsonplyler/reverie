title: Testing out the Markdown

I'm editing this directly in GitHub. 

Note in the bottom left. 

I never downloaded this to my computer. 


Now I'm going to test the Markdown implementation.

Note the way I'm showing this syntax should be JavaScript:
```javascript

let colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow"]

colors.forEach(color=>console.log(color))

```

How cool, right?

I'm going to press CTRL+SHIFT+V to preview the markdown in a VS Code window. No dice. 

But I'm going to now commit. Remember. This was never on my home machine.
