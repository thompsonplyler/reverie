It's always good to have a card-flipper in your code toolkit. This one is mine. 

The z-index levels and opacity aren't arbitrary. They reflect the apparent position of the card on the y-axis. Changing the values of transition-duration to something longer gives a closer look at why the transition values are the way they are.
