My name is Thompson Plyler. I make web pages. I am currently transfixed by JAMstack and 3D applications with VR/AR, but I honestly fascinated by nearly everything. This blog is mostly a product of me being excited by Jekyll and finally getting what the hullaballoo about GitHub Pages is all about. 

While I'll eventually cannibalize the base components, the armature of this blog is the [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) Jekyll theme, a simple and opinionated fork of [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) with some additional features and personal touches.
